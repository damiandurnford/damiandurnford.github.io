##The Best Life Ever

1.This world would like to make me lonely, but I got my friends with me.

We’re trying hard to help others find friends eternally.

When I would worry about me, oh, this world would bring me down.

I’m feeling better lifting others off the ground.

Look what I’ve found.

(CHORUS)

I want to know what I can do; I want to give what I can give.

That is the best feeling ever.

I know this’ll last forever. I’m where I want to be.

This is the best life ever.

2.So many good things yet to be done with these two hands of mine.

I’ll take some love and build us a bridge—⁠connects your heart to mine.

When I would worry about me, oh, this world would bring me down.

I’m feeling better lifting others off the ground.

Look what I’ve found.

(CHORUS)

I want to know what I can do; I want to give what I can give.

That is the best feeling ever.

I know this’ll last forever. It’s better than a dream.

This is the best life.

(BRIDGE)

I’m not afraid, come what may.

This kind of life gets better ev’ry day—⁠ev’ry day, ev’ry way.

(CHORUS)

Oh, I want to live for more than me; I want to give ’til I feel free.

That is the best feeling ever.

I know this’ll last forever. Come with me; you’ll see.

This is the best life ever.

This is the best life ever.

This is the best life ever.
